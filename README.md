This cheatsheet consists of functional Node.js expressions that demonstrate basic usage.
Some expressions are embedded with examples of other types of expressions in them, giving the cheatsheet characteristics of a demo more than of a documentation.
It is intended for entry level users, for example learning Node.js as their first or second programming language.
All code here is executable except for code requiring external modules (see '/* Packages */', in code).
